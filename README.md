## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm.

So to set things up you need to run

```bash
yarn install
```

or just

```bash
yarn
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and it should open at

> http://localhost:3000/

## Deployment

Nothing special, its setup at Netlify end (in other words: no `netlify.toml`), just merge a feat branch to master branch and you're good.
